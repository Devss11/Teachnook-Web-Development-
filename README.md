## 📝 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. View the styled content centered around Jeon Jungkook.


## 📌 Notes

- The `<div align="center">` attribute is considered outdated in modern HTML5. Using CSS with Flexbox or Grid is recommended for layout and alignment.
- The `<br>` tag should be self-closing in XHTML (`<br />`), but in HTML5, closing is optional. However, using `<br>` for structure instead of CSS is not a best practice.
